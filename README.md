# SQL-AIRPORT-MANAGEMENT

For our project we have chosen to do an Airline Reservation database, where our ERD diagram illustrates the different entities representing the significant elements of the airline reservation mini-world. The design of the database encompasses five main components: the passenger, a flight , a reservation , an airport, and a frequent flyer subscription.

Special Thanks to Hugo Urquieta (My Partner in this project)
